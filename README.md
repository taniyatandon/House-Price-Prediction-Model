# House Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and location.  
It demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, encoding, scaling, model training, evaluation, and model saving.

## Features
- Handles missing values and categorical encoding  
- Performs feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  
- Trains and compares Linear Regression and Random Forest models  
- Includes cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Saves the best-trained model (`best_house_price_model.joblib`)
